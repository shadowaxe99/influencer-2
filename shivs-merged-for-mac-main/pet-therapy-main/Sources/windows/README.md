## üõ†Ô∏è Running the app
Works on macOS and Windows, did not test on any Linux distro yet.
```bash
cd Sources/windows
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running tests
```bash
cd Sources/windows
python3 -m unittest discover -p "*_tests.py"
```

## üß± Build from source
I'm using PyInstaller to package the app into a Windows executable:
```bash
python3 build.py debug
```
This will create a `DesktopPets.exe` file in the `dist` folder.

See `build.py`, `release.spec` and `debug.spec` for more information.
