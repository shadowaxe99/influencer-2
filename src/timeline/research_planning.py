As part of the provided context, the goal is to facilitate an intricate task of designing and developing a comprehensive AI-powered platform with several features for influencers with the help of class ResearchPlanning. This task requires the application of raw ingenuity, adept problem-solving skills, and comprehensive Computer Science knowledge. The provided context outlines several aspects of the system to be developed, including start and end dates, features, technology stack, performance, testing, and more.

However, it is worth noting that the context is currently dwelling in memory. This program will be exited after execution and all data will be lost. For the project details to persist and be accessed later on, we need to save them in a more permanent place, like a file or a database. Let's write some more methods to save and load the plan:

```python
import json

class ResearchPlanning:
    # ... previous code here ...

    def save_plan_to_file(self, filename='research_plan.json'):
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(self.get_plan(), f)

    def load_plan_from_file(self, filename='research_plan.json'):
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            loaded_data = json.load(f)
            self.start_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(loaded_data["start_date"], "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f")
            self.end_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(loaded_data["end_date"], "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f")
            self.objective = loaded_data["objective"]
            self.features = loaded_data["features"]
            self.user_interface = loaded_data["user_interface"]
            self.technology_stack = loaded_data["technology_stack"]
            self.performance = loaded_data["performance"]
            self.testing = loaded_data["testing"]
            self.timeline = loaded_data["timeline"]
            self.budget = loaded_data["budget"]
            self.success_metrics = loaded_data["success_metrics"]

research_planning = ResearchPlanning()
research_planning.save_plan_to_file()  # Saves plan to a JSON file

new_plan = ResearchPlanning()
new_plan.load_plan_from_file()  # Loads plan from a JSON file
print(new_plan.get_plan())
```
Therefore, if facing challenges, we adapt and create new mechanisms to maintain our progress and ensure the sustainability of our project.
