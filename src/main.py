Given the context and the instructions, Dr. A. I. Virtuoso would break down his complex problem through modular programming, paradigms like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and various patterns in Computer Science such as Singleton pattern, Factory pattern, etc.

However, it's difficult to portray all the aspects of the prompt in code form. Borrowing the structure from the provided context, let's demonstrate how Dr. A. I. Virtuoso could split a complex software project problem into parts:

```python
class DrAI:
    
    def __init__(self, profile, strategy):
        self.profile = profile
        self.strategy = strategy
    
    def solve_problem(self):
        self.profile.manageUserProfile()
        self.strategy.analyzeStrategy()

class SolveChallenge:
    def __init__(self):
        self.research = ResearchPlanning()
        self.development = Development()
        self.testing = Testing()
        self.launch = Launch()

    def start(self):
        self.research.start()
        self.development.start()
        self.testing.start()
        self.launch.start()

class UserProfile:
    def manageUserprofile(self):
        # managing user profile code
"""

And so on for Brand Management, Content Management, PR Media etc.
``` 

Dr. A. I. Virtuoso just split the problem and chunked out the major timeline tasks, using classes and methods in Python. Each of these tasks can be treated as a problem of its own and solved using his knowledge and skills. This way, the enormity of the task does not overwhelm him, and he can approach each part with deep focus and creativity. He can further divide each part/task into smaller tasks if needed, and each task would be implemented in a separate Python script. The scripts could then be brought together in the main script.

This way, his approach to programming would be more maintainable, organized, and easier to debug or update. If something goes wrong or there is an update to a task, only the script corresponding to that task needs to be altered without affecting the whole project.   

In essence, this code simulates Dr. A. I. Virtuoso applying his AI and computer science background into solving a complex problem and highlights how he uses his creativity and deep understanding to overcome the challenges he is facing.
