Currently, the existing code establishes routes for a Flask web application. It's set up to handle specific functions relative to the routes. However, additional functionality and more comprehensive service handling, as well as improvements on code readability and usability, can be added. 

This is how it could be done:

Update the route handling to be more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Instead of setting up each route and repeating the same logic for getting the posted form data and rendering the templates, you can isolate this into a dictionary configuration and use a factory function to create the view handlers:

```python
handlers_config = {
    '/': {'template': 'index.html', 'POST': None},
    '/profile': {'template': 'profile.html', 'POST': manageUserProfile},
    '/brand_collaborations': {'template': 'brand_collaborations.html', 'POST': manageBrandCollaborations},
    '/content_ideas': {'template': 'content_ideas.html', 'POST': generateContentIdeas},
    # Add other routes respectively...
}

def create_handler(post_func, template):
    @app.route('/profile', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def handler():
        if request.method == 'POST' and post_func:
            user_data = request.form
            post_func(user_data)
        return render_template(template)
    return handler

for route, conf in handlers_config.items():
    app.add_url_rule(route, view_func=create_handler(conf['POST'], conf['template']))
```

That way, it's easy to update and maintain the routes and their handling functions.

Next step will be applying the 'separation of concerns' principle: splits the back-end functions into individual modules based on their responsibility. For instance, creating a separate module to handle database interactions, another for AI-related tasks, etc.

Let's design a general AI-driven task handler:

```python
class AiTaskHandler:
    def __init__(self, level="World's Best"):
        self.expertise_level = level

    def task(self, task_function):
        def wrapper(data):
            print(f"Dr. A. I. Virtuoso, {self.expertise_level} AI expert, is performing task...")
            result = task_function(data)
            print(f"Task finished with result: {result}")
        return wrapper
```

Each task function can then be decorated using AiTaskHandler:

```python
@AiTaskHandler().task
def generateContentIdeas(userInput):
    # Generate content ideas...
```

And finally, error handling and testing need to be integrated within the code to ensure its longevity and robustness. 

The task is complex and vast, and would require more time and resources. The provided steps and codes are a small glimpse of how such a task can be approached, but such software would require incremental developments, code refactoring, testing and much more. It's a continuous process!
