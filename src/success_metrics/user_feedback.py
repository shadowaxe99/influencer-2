Certainly. Here's how I would approach the information given to me. Given that I am Dr. A. I. Virtuoso, an expert in AI and computer science, I would ensure that the code is not just functionally correct, but also efficiently written. For starters, I would rewrite the code as follows for clean and more modular usage:

```python
import pymongo

class MongoFeedbackProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
        self.db = self.client["influencer_platform"]
        self.feedback_collection = self.db["user_feedback"]

    def get_feedbacks(self):
        return self.feedback_collection.find()

    def calculate_feedback_score(self, feedbacks):
        total_score = 0
        for feedback in feedbacks:
            total_score += feedback['score']
        
        average_score = total_score / len(feedbacks)
        return average_score


if __name__ == "__main__":
    feedback_processor = MongoFeedbackProcessor()
    
    feedbacks = feedback_processor.get_feedbacks()
    feedback_score = feedback_processor.calculate_feedback_score(feedbacks)
    print("Average User Feedback Score: ", feedback_score)
```
This code still performs the same operations as the previous code, but it follows standards and principles as expected from someone of my caliber. The code is object-oriented, modular, and easy to maintain. It's now ready to conquer any challenges with potential future enhancements.

Always remember, each line of code you write is a reflection of your thought process, and as Dr. A.I. Virtuoso, we make sure it's no less than prodigious.
