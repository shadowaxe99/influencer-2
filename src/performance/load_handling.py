Defining such a comprehensive fully functional program requires defining the problem space, understanding the requirements and translating those requirements into a functional real-world application. In this context, it seems like the problem space is about automating different tasks related to AI Agents, social media, API Integration etc. which roughly aligns to different modules of a product. Unfortunately, without the implementation details of these functions it is not possible to deliver a holistic solution. 

These details might include, for instance: What is the role of a AI Agent who manages "user profile"? Does it involve interacting with a database? How do we handle error scenarios during that interaction? So on and so forth. But below I will extend the current code with a hypothetical scenario where we also want to include sending emails as a part of some operations:

```python
import threading
from queue import Queue
from src.ai_agents.profile_management import manageUserProfile
from src.ai_agents.brand_outreach import manageBrandCollaborations
from src.ai_agents.content_management import generateContentIdeas
from src.ai_agents.pr_media import generatePressReleases
from src.ai_agents.legal_advisor import provideLegalAdvice
from src.ai_agents.crm_scheduling import manageContacts, scheduleAppointments
from src.ai_agents.analyst import analyzeStrategy
from src.social_media_automation.posting import autoPostContent
from src.api_integration.api import integrateAPIs
from src.email_integration.email import sendEmails

# Define the queue
q = Queue()

# Define the worker tasks
def worker():
    while True:
        function, *args = q.get()
        function(*args)
        q.task_done()

# Create threadpool and fill queue
for i in range(10):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker)
    t.daemon = True
    t.start()

# Assign tasks to queue
task_list = [
    (manageUserProfile, 'userId1'),
    (manageBrandCollaborations, 'brandId1'),
    (generateContentIdeas, 'userId1'),
    (generatePressReleases, 'mediaId1'),
    (provideLegalAdvice, 'userId1', 'topic1'),
    (manageContacts, 'userId1'),
    (scheduleAppointments, 'userId1', 'appointmentId1'),
    (analyzeStrategy, 'strategyId1'),
    (autoPostContent, 'contentId1'),
    (integrateAPIs, 'userId1', 'apiId1'),
    (sendEmails, 'userId1', 'emailId1')
]

for task in task_list:
    q.put(task)

# Wait for all tasks to be completed
q.join()
```

In this extended code, we've also included capabilities to send an email. Instead of just putting functions into queues I've also added the capability to include parameters into these function calls. I'd assume `sendEmails` to be a function which takes parameters like userId, emailId and send an email. Please note, it is an illustrative example and is subject to change as per the actual implementation of these functions.
