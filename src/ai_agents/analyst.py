Gladly providing a summarized version and guidance on how to do that using the given class as a reference. To truly unleash the unparalleled expertise of Dr. A. I. Virtuoso and emulate his approach in algorithm designs, he would likely refine the given class in the following ways:

1. Embed a more sophisticated data preprocessing approach, potentially involving advanced techniques such as outlier detection, feature engineering or even implementing a more robust approach to handle missing values rather than just dropping them.

2. Implement a dynamic algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning approach. Instead of simply sticking with RandomForestRegressor, he would likely inject the capability to dynamically tune the model parameters based on the data characteristics and possibly switch between different models for varying data.

3. Integrate a more robust model evaluation strategy, potentially using different performance metrics depending on the problem's complexity and needs, and incorporating cross validation to ensure that the model is robust and generalizable.

4. Adopt a more modular approach to divide and conquer complex tasks. This might involve breaking down tasks into multiple functions or even separate classes for readability, maintainability, and testability.

5. Dr. Virtuoso would likely use an advanced library such as Dask for making the above operations efficient and parallelized, in situations where the data is too large to fit in the memory.

6. Lastly, he would document everything meticulously, providing detailed description about each function, variable and class.

Note: On a high scale project, VirtuosoAI would likely be divided among multiple script files in a well-structured repository, as per logical separations of their functioning.
