The given context does not include any interaction or reference to an artificial intelligence algorithm. Additionally, user interaction, dependencies, data structure, function requirements, or coding modules aren't specified in the context. As such, continuing this code from where it left off would require making assumptions and extrapolating based on typical content management agent strategies involving artificial intelligence (AI).

Here's an example of how to proceed:
```python
    def save_content(self, content):
        # Let's assume here that content is a list of dictionaries
        for c in content:
            filename = f"{c['brand']}_content.txt"
            with open(filename, 'w') as f:
                f.write(c['content'])

    def load_content(self, brand):
        filename = f"{brand}_content.txt"
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
        return content

    def generate_personalized_content(self, userProfile):
        # This function will use advanced AI algorithms to personalize content for each user based on their profile
        # As this kind of function can become quite complex, its implementation may need to be divided among multiple files or classes.
        # As we don't have access to userProfile and any AI model at the moment, this function is not implemented. 
        pass

    def analyze_feedback(self, feedback):
        # Perform sentiment analysis on the feedback to determine user satisfaction.
        # Update content generation approach based on the feedback analysis results.
        pass

    def handle_exceptions(self):
        # Write robust and handling code to address all plausible exceptions and edge-cases
        pass
```
Remember, Dr. A. I. Virtuoso, we're creating the structure of a comprehensive content management agent. The specific AI algorithms, user profile attributes, and user feedback analysis are yet to be added, based on the real data and models available. They must be implemented with the same high standards, thoroughly tested, and continually optimized based on the users' feedback.

More in-depth functions, user collaborations, and data handling require additional context or specifications.
