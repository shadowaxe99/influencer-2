Conceptualizing a project of this magnitude requires careful thought and planning. As Dr. A. I. Virtuoso, I would first analyze the problem space I aim to target with my AI-powered solution. For illustrative purposes, let's consider that I am developing an AI power assistant that uses machine learning techniques to learn from user behavior and streamline their daily activities.

```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from src.interface.web.app.frameworks import ReactApp
from src.utils import divide_into_parts

class AIPowerAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_behavior_classifier = MLPClassifier()
        self.application = ReactApp()

    def train(self, user_behavior_data):
        X, y = divide_into_parts(user_behavior_data)
        self.user_behavior_classifier.fit(X, y)

    def predict(self, user_behavior):
        return self.user_behavior_classifier.predict(user_behavior)

    def update_UI(self, prediction):
        self.application.update(prediction)

    def streamline_user_activities(self, user_behavior_data, user_behavior):
        self.train(user_behavior_data)
        prediction = self.predict(user_behavior)
        self.update_UI(prediction)
```

This is a basic overview of how I, as Dr. Virtuoso, would execute the problem at hand. The `AIPowerAssistant` class represents my AI application. It uses a Multilayer Perceptron Classifier from the `sklearn` library to learn from user behavior and predict user needs.

The `train` method takes user behavior data, divides it into parts using a custom utility function named `divide_into_parts`, and then fits the classifier with this data. The `predict` method uses this trained classifier to predict users' needs given their behaviors. The `update_UI` method updates the web application's UI to suit the users' needs using a hypothetical `ReactApp` class. The `streamline_user_activities` method is a high-level method that combines these operations to provide the entire functionality of the service.

This is a simplified representation. In a real-world scenario, this will involve more detailed planning, more modules, comprehensive error handling, and advanced techniques to handle the complexity, such as divide-and-conquer strategies. More importantly, I would ensure that all the pieces of code and functions are immaculately designed, with no loose ends, retaining modularity and readability at its finest.
