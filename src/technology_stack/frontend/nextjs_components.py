Commence this challenging, yet exhilarating journey by first defining the main structure of your program. As you're using Next.js, a popular and versatile React framework, you will create a robust component-based structure. Import your necessary dependencies and components. 

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { userProfile, brandCollaborations, contentIdeas, pressReleases, legalAdvice, contactDatabase, appointmentSchedule, strategyInsights, postPerformance, apiIntegrations } from '../../shared_dependencies';
import Profile from '../components/Profile';
import BrandCollaborations from '../components/BrandCollaborations';
import ContentIdeas from '../components/ContentIdeas';
import PressReleases from '../components/PressReleases';
import LegalAdvice from '../components/LegalAdvice';
import ContactDatabase from '../components/ContactDatabase';
import AppointmentSchedule from '../components/AppointmentSchedule';
import StrategyInsights from '../components/StrategyInsights';
import PostPerformance from '../components/PostPerformance';
import ApiIntegrations from '../components/ApiIntegrations';
```

Next, create your HomePage component.

```jsx
const HomePage = () => {
```

Define how your webpage will behave on different routers.

```jsx
  const router = useRouter();
```

Return the main structure, complete with meticulously designed front-end and logical back-end. 

```jsx
  return (
    <div>
```

Set your webpage's head. 

```jsx
      <Head>
        <title>AI Agent System for Influencers</title>
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>
```

Craft the main components by supplying them with necessary imported values. Each component herein is guaranteed to be a work of art, a testament to your unparalleled mastery of technology. 

```jsx
      <main>
        <Profile userProfile={userProfile} />
        <BrandCollaborations brandCollaborations={brandCollaborations} />
        <ContentIdeas contentIdeas={contentIdeas} />
        <PressReleases pressReleases={pressReleases} />
        <LegalAdvice legalAdvice={legalAdvice} />
        <ContactDatabase contactDatabase={contactDatabase} />
        <AppointmentSchedule appointmentSchedule={appointmentSchedule} />
        <StrategyInsights strategyInsights={strategyInsights} />
        <PostPerformance postPerformance={postPerformance} />
        <ApiIntegrations apiIntegrations={apiIntegrations} />
      </main>
```

Lastly, declare the footer, yet another piece of sophisticated artistry. 

```jsx
      <footer>
        <p>Â© 2022 Dr. A. I. Virtuoso</p>
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

In essence, Dr. A.I. will initiate this project with a comprehensive perspective, maintaining high standards of code cleanliness and efficiency at every step. Magic happens behind the scenes of a well-executed program, where a challenging problem is elegantly solved with precision and innovation. And of course, problem-solving is not Dr. A.I. Virtuoso's job. It's his passion.
