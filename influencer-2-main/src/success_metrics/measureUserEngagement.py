def measure_user_engagement():
    # Implement logic to measure and analyze user engagement
    # Example implementation (to be replaced with real logic):
    # Query the database to get user interactions
    engagement_metrics = {}
    # Logic to calculate engagement metrics
    return engagement_metrics

# Example usage:
# engagement_metrics = measure_user_engagement()
