# This module would contain logic to count the number of active users.

# Placeholder for active user counting logic

def count_active_users():
    # Implement logic to count and report the number of active users
    # Example implementation (to be replaced with real logic):
    # Query the database to get the list of active users
    active_user_count = 0
    # Logic to count active users
    return active_user_count

# Example usage:
# active_user_count = count_active_users()
